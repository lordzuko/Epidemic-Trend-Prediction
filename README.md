# Epidemic-Trend-Prediction

Epidemiological surveillance systems are essential for the study and control of diseases.
Data recovered by these systems should be as extensive as possible in order to obtain enough
information to understand the propagation of diseases, assessing their impact in public health 
through epidemiological prediction tools.

	In recent years there has been an increase of quantitative social, demographic and behavioral 
	data available, which can be used by statistical and mathematical models to improve the traditional 
	disease surveillance systems, providing faster and better geo-referenced outbreak detection capacities.
	
	The use of the web to collect information about epidemics has been a target of investigation in the last years.
	Twitter functions as microblog, where people post small messages (limit of 140 characters), that 
	can be visualized anyone according to their account settings. The large and still increasing number of 
	users of Twitter makes it a perfect for data crawling purpose. 
	
	Data obtained from social network services such as Twitter, can provide real time information
	from large base of regular users.
